"<h4>Manage Database Instructions</h4>
<p>On this page the following functions can be selected:</p>
<h5>Compact database</h5>
<p>When a user deletes an event, the event will be marked as 'deleted', but will 
not be removed from the database. The Compact Database function will permanently 
remove events deleted more than 30 days ago from the database and free the space 
occupied by these events.</p>
<h5>Backup database</h5>
<p>This function wil create a backup of the full calendar database (tables 
structure and contents) in .sql format. The backup will be saved in the 
<strong>files/</strong> directory with file name: 
<kbd>cal-dump-yyyymmdd-hhmmss.sql</kbd> (where 'yyyymmdd' = year, month, and 
day, and hhmmss = hour, minutes and seconds.</p>
<p>The backup file can be used to recreate the calendar database (structure and 
data), via the restore function described below or by using for instance the 
<strong>phpMyAdmin</strong> tool, which is provided by most web hosts.</p>
<h5>Restore database</h5>
<p>This function will restore the calendar database with the contents of the 
uploaded backup file (file type .sql).</p>
<p>When restoring the database, ALL CURRENTLY PRESENT DATA WILL BE LOST!</p>
<p>After restoring a backup file of a previous LuxCal version, you must run the 
latest upgradexxx.php script to ensure the database tables are up to date!</p>
<h5>Events</h5>
<p>This function will delete or undelete events which are occurring between the 
specified dates. If a date is left blank, there is no date limit; so if both 
dates are left blank, ALL EVENTS WILL BE DELETED!</p><br>
<p>IMPORTANT: When the database is compacted (see above), the events which are 
permanently removed from the database cannot be undeleted anymore!</p>",

"xpl_import_csv" =>
"<h4>CSV Import Instructions</h4>
<p>This form is used to import a <strong>Comma Separated Values (CSV)</strong> text 
file with event data into the LuxCal Calendar.</p>
<p>The order of columns in the CSV file must be: title, venue, category id (see 
below), date, end date, start time, end time and description. The first row of the 
CSV file, used for column descriptions, is ignored.</p>
<h5>Sample CSV files</h5>
<p>Sample CSV files can be found in the 'files/' directory of your LuxCal download.</p>
<h5>Date and time format</h5>
<p>The selected event date format and event time format on the left must match the 
format of the dates and times in the uploaded CSV file.</p>
<h5>Table of Categories</h5>
<p>The calendar uses ID numbers to specify categories. The category IDs in the CSV 
file should correspond to the categories used in your calendar or be blank.</p>
<p>If in the next step you want to earmark events as 'birthday', the <strong>Birthday 
category ID</strong> must be set to the corresponding ID in the category list below.</p>

target='_blank'>RFC5545 standard</a></u>] of the Internet Engineering Task Force.</p>
<p>Only events will be imported; other iCal components, like: To-Do, Jounal, Free / 
Busy, Time zone and Alarm, will be ignored.</p>
<p>Sample iCalendar files can be found in the 'files/' directory of your LuxCal 
download.</p>

<p>The calendar uses ID numbers to specify categories. The category IDs in the 
iCalendar file should correspond to the categories used in your calendar or be

"<h4>iCalendar Export Instructions</h4>
<p>This form is used to extract and export <strong>iCalendar</strong> events from 
the LuxCal Calendar.</p>
<p>The <b>iCal file name</b> (without extension) is optional. Created files will 
be stored in the \"files/\" directory on the server with the specified file name, 
or otherwise with the name of the calendar. The file extension will be <b>.ics</b>.
Existing files in the \"files/\" directory on the server with the same name will 
be overwritten by the new file.</p>
<p>The <b>iCal file description</b> (e.g. 'Meetings 2013') is optional. If 
entered, it will be added to the header of the exported iCal file.</p>
<p><b>Event filters</b>: The events to be extracted can be filtered by:</p>
<ul>
<li>event owner</li>
<li>event category</li>
<li>event start date</li>
<li>event added/last modified date</li>
</ul>
<p>Each filter is optional. A blank date means: no limit</p>
